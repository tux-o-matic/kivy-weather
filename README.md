# Kivy Weather
### Kivy sample app based on examples from [O'Reilly's Kivy book](https://github.com/oreillymedia/creating_apps_in_kivy).

The book being written several years ago, some classes from Kivy have been deprecated so this sample app is implemented against the more recent Kivy 1.10.

Main changes:
- Use of Kivy RecycleView and DataModel instead of List.
- Build Open Weather client to use an API key (to specify in weather.ini).
- Added option to persist search history.
